# ScratchNet

**Language used**: Python (version=3.6)

## Description
This repository holds one of my first Deep Learning projects. The project implements an MNIST classifying densely connected neural network from scratch (in python) using only NumPy for numeric computaions.

>I follow the ideology that while learning new Machine Learning or Deep Learning (abbreviated as ML or DL from hereon) alsgorithms and techniques, it's always a good idea to implememt any newly learnt algorithm from scratch, without using any ML/DL frameworks.


The densely connected neural networks has been programmed to use any architecture which can be specified by the user in the form of a pyhton list where the i'th member of the list specifies the number of neurons in the i'th  neuron.
